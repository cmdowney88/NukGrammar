1.  Description of any further steps you had to take to get from the automatically constructed choice file to one that would both (a) customize and (b) compile.
    -### David, I think you did most of the stuff with the customization system this week
    -Early on, we had a grammar that would compile correctly, but could not be loaded into LKB
        -We discovered that this was because of two Verb Position Classes that specified both 1st and 2nd Person values
        -These seem to be 2ndSub, 1stObj
        -To fix this, we modified the choices file to take away the conflicting Person constraints

2. Your answers to the questions about the initial and final [incr tsdb()] runs, for both test corpus and test suite, repeated here:
   1. How many items parsed?
        -Corpus Initial: 32/649
        -Corpus Final: 30/649
        -Testsuite Initial: 5/17
        -Testsuite Final: 9/17
   2. What is the average number of parses per parsed item?
        -Corpus Initial: 2.25
        -Corpus Final: 2.23
        -Testsuite Initial: 1.2
        -Testsuite Final: 1.11
   3. How many parses did the most ambiguous item receive?
        -Corpus Initial: 6
        -Corpus Final: 6
        -Testsuite Initial: 2
        -Testsuite Final: 2
   4. What sources of ambiguity can you identify?

   5. For 10 items (if you have at least that many parsing), do any of the parses look reasonable in the semantics? (Emily will demo in class on Tuesday.) 

3. Documentation of the phenomena you have added to your testsuite, illustrated with examples from the testsuite.
    -Basic Indicative Mood, marked by the clitic "=maˑ"
        -Example #1: weʔič=maˑ ~ sleep=INDIC ~ `he/she/it/they sleep'
    -Temporal Marker (aspect-ish), marked by clitic "=!aƛ"
        -Example #3: nunuˑk=!aƛ=maˑ ~ sing=TEMP=INDIC ~ `he/she/it/they are singing'
        -(note: David glosses this as =NOW; it seems to add a sort of definiteness to the time, but not necessarily perfective or imperfective)
    -Agreement, mostly 1sg, marked by the clitic "=aˑḥ" or "siˑ"
        -Example #13: weʔič=!aƛ=maˑ=aˑḥ ~ sleep=TEMP=INDIC=1sg ~ `I am sleeping'
        -Example #5: weʔič=!aƛ=mit=siˑ ~ sleep=TEMP=PAST=1sg ~ `I was sleeping'
    -Past Tense, marked by the clitic "=mit"
        -Example #5: weʔič=!aƛ=mit=siˑ ~ sleep=TEMP=PAST=1sg ~ `I was sleeping'
    -Aspect: Perfective, Durative, and Continuative
        -Example #6: ciq-šiƛ=!aƛ=maˑ ~ speak-PER=TEMP=INDIC ~ `he/she/it/they spoke'
        -Example #15: qaḥ=ak ~ die=DUR ~ `dead'
        -Example #17: mat-aˑ ~ fly-CONT ~ `flying'

4. Documentation of the choices you made in the customization system, illustrated with examples from your test suite.
    -One problem we came across was that the Indicitive suffix "=maˑ" and the 1sg agreement suffix "=aˑḥ" were in conflict in our grammar even though they occur together in the natural language
        -We found this was because the rule for the Indicative suffix was also adding the value of 3rd-person, which was incompatible with any other Person value
        -This seems to be because the IGT analyzes the the Indicative as adding 3rd person "by default" if no other agreement occurs. However, this cannot be overridden in our grammar.
        -We confirmed this hypothesis by modifying the tdl files to not at the 3rd person value
	-We then fixed this in the choices file by ... ###David###

5. Descriptions of any properties of your language illustrated in your test suite but not covered by your starter grammar and/or the customization system.

6. If you have identified ways (other than those you reported last week) in which the automatically created choices file is particularly off-base, please report them here. If you can include IGT from the testsuite or your descriptive materials illustrating the problem, that is even better.
