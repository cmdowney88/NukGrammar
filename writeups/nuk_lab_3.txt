1.  Description of any further steps you had to take to get from the automatically constructed choice file to one that would both (a) customize and (b) compile.
    -### David, I think you did most of the stuff with the customization system this week

2. Your answers to the questions about the initial and final [incr tsdb()] runs, for both test corpus and test suite, repeated here:
   1. How many items parsed?
        -Corpus Initial: 32/649
        -Corpus Final: 30/649
        -Testsuite Initial: 5/17
        -Testsuite Final: 9/17
   2. What is the average number of parses per parsed item?
        -Corpus Initial: 2.25
        -Corpus Final: 2.23
        -Testsuite Initial: 1.2
        -Testsuite Final: 1.11
   3. How many parses did the most ambiguous item receive?
        -Corpus Initial: 6
        -Corpus Final: 6
        -Testsuite Initial: 2
        -Testsuite Final: 2
    4. What sources of ambiguity can you identify?

    5. For 10 items (if you have at least that many parsing), do any of the parses look reasonable in the semantics? (Emily will demo in class on Tuesday.) 
        -#1590: ʔaƛakʷał-iip, glossed 'eight-get' / "he was the one who got eight"; the _eight_v_rel is present, but nothing for "get"
        -#940: ƛupk-šiƛ k̓ʷalsic, 'wake-MO Kwalisits' / "Kwalisits woke up", there is both a _wake_v_rel and _Kwalisits_n_rel, the ARG1 of the first seems to be properly identified with the ARG0 of the second
        -#970: tux-cpaˑ k̓ʷalsic 'jump-on.side Kwalisits' / "Kwalisits jumped over him" also has a _jump_v_rel whose ARG1 is Kwalisits, but there doesn't seem to be anything about another person being jumped over
        -#990: ḥis-šiƛ 'bleed-PERF' / "It bled", the bleed relation is in place but the aspect information is not included
        -#4050: ʕatiq-šiƛ=suuk 'thank-PERF=NEUT.2SG' / "you thank them"; there is a thank relation, and the ARG1 of this is correctly identified with the 2nd Person Sg index corresponding to XARG
        -#6410: hił=int=waˑʔš maḥt̓aʕs 'at=PST=HRSY.3 Queens.Cove' / "he was at Queens Cove"; there is an _at_v_rel that correctly has an ARG1 identified with XARG, however the _queens.cove_n_rel also identifies its ARG0 witht his index, which seems to be giving the incorrect reading that it is Queen's Cove that is at something
       -#4400: t̓aamuux-ʔatu 'dive.like.a.kingfisher-downward' / "Dive down like a Kingfisher"; most of this word is one morpheme, and the dive relation is present, but there is nothing expressing the "down" relation
       -#110: wawaa 'say.CT' / "he said"; the semantics for this one are surprisingly complex, and the ARG2 of the say relation seems to have an embedded mrs of its own, including something about Focus it seems...although it seems reasonable for the predication of "he said (that) ___"
       -#4150: hupii=suuk 'help=NEUT.2SG' / "Help them"; the _help_v_reln is properly indexed with the 2sg XARG; again there doesn't seem to be a relation for the object
       -#3660:wał-šiƛ-LS=!aƛ=ʔał 'go.home-PERF-GR=TEMP=3PL' / "they were going home"; the _go.home_v_rel is properly indexed with a 3pl XARG; as with other examples, no TAM information seems to be being incorporated

3. Documentation of the phenomena you have added to your testsuite, illustrated with examples from the testsuite.
    -Basic Indicative Mood, marked by the clitic "=maˑ"
        -Example #1: weʔič=maˑ ~ sleep=INDIC ~ `he/she/it/they sleep'
    -Temporal Marker (aspect-ish), marked by clitic "=!aƛ"
        -Example #3: nunuˑk=!aƛ=maˑ ~ sing=TEMP=INDIC ~ `he/she/it/they are singing'
        -(note: David glosses this as =NOW; it seems to add a sort of definiteness to the time, but not necessarily perfective or imperfective)
    -Agreement, mostly 1sg, marked by the clitic "=aˑḥ" or "siˑ"
        -Example #13: weʔič=!aƛ=maˑ=aˑḥ ~ sleep=TEMP=INDIC=1sg ~ `I am sleeping'
        -Example #5: weʔič=!aƛ=mit=siˑ ~ sleep=TEMP=PAST=1sg ~ `I was sleeping'
    -Past Tense, marked by the clitic "=mit"
        -Example #5: weʔič=!aƛ=mit=siˑ ~ sleep=TEMP=PAST=1sg ~ `I was sleeping'
    -Aspect: Perfective, Durative, and Continuative
        -Example #6: ciq-šiƛ=!aƛ=maˑ ~ speak-PER=TEMP=INDIC ~ `he/she/it/they spoke'
        -Example #15: qaḥ=ak ~ die=DUR ~ `dead'
        -Example #17: mat-aˑ ~ fly-CONT ~ `flying'

4. Documentation of the choices you made in the customization system, illustrated with examples from your test suite.
        This can be interleaved with the documentation of the phenomena (so you describe each phenomenon and then the choices you used to add an analysis of it to the grammar), but the documentation of the phenomenon and choices should be logically separate. Here's an example of what this should look like.
    -### Similarly here. You were able to replicate the changes I made
        to the tdl through changes to the choices file, but you know
        best how you did that
5. Descriptions of any properties of your language illustrated in your test suite but not covered by your starter grammar and/or the customization system.

6. If you have identified ways (other than those you reported last week) in which the automatically created choices file is particularly off-base, please report them here. If you can include IGT from the testsuite or your descriptive materials illustrating the problem, that is even better.
