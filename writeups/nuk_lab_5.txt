## Clausal Complements ##

## Clausal Modifiers ##
The most clear-cut case of clausal modifiers in Nuuchahnulth is "because" clauses of the form "I am sleeping because he is talking" (Example 43). In general, subordinate clauses are marked by Mood clitics appearing on the subordinate verb. However, "because" clauses are also demarcated by the apparent complementizer ʔani. When used in this way, subordinate clauses also have to take the clitic indicating the Subordinate Mood.

#EXAMPLE 43

Judgment: g
Phenomena: {clausal-mod}
weʔič=!aƛ=maˑḥ ʔani ciq=!aƛ=qaˑ

'I am sleeping because he/she is speaking'

#EXAMPLE 46

ciq=!aƛ=maˑḥ ʔani ʔaya=!aƛ p̓iš-mis ʔaḥkuu=ʔiˑ
speak=TEMP=INDIC.1sg COMP many=NOW bad-NMLZ D1=ARTL
'I am speaking because there is much evil here now'

To enable these sorts of constructions in our Nuuchahnulth grammar, we added a strategy to the Clausal Modifiers section of the customization system. The strategy specifies a free subordinator to come before the subordinate clause that acts as the head of the phrase and introduces a _because_subord_rel. Some data from the corpus suggests that the behavior of this subordinator may be slightly more complex than we postulate here, showing possible agreement with the subject of the coordinated phrase (Example 45), but for the time being we have chosen not to model this distinction.

'They can't be seen because we're so far out at sea'

## Evidentials ##

Our treatment of evidentials led us down a route that became more complicated than we anticipated, but added significant clarity to our grammar. In Nuuchahnulth, things like Hearsay, Doubt, Indication, Assertion, and Question are all indicated through a mutually-exclusive paradigm of Mood clitics. There are 12 Mood values in total, and we refined Indicative, Quotative, Subordinate, Conditional, and Dubiative for this week. The confusion for our work this week came from the fact that these Mood clitics are always accompanied by material indexing the Person and Number of the clause Subject. This material differs significantly between each of the Moods, and in different resources it is inconsistently marked as either Fusional or Agglutinating (clear boundary). In the end, we chose to abide by the Fusional analysis, and so refined choices for 5 affixes for each Mood: one each for 1sg, 1pl, 2sg, 2pl, and 3rd (no number on 3rd). These can be seen in Examples 54, 58, and 59

#EXAMPLE 54
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {evidential, negation}
wik=!aƛ=weˑʔisi ciq-šiƛ
NEG=TEMP=QUOT.1sg speak-PERF
'It is said that I didn't speak'

#EXAMPLE 58
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {evidential, agreement, mood}
ciq-šiƛ=!aƛ=weˑʔincuk
speak-PERF=TEMP=QUOT.2sg
'It is said that you spoke'

#EXAMPLE 59
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {evidential, agreement, mood}
ciq-šiƛ=!aƛ=weˑʔinni
speak-PERF=TEMP=QUOT.1pl
'It is said that we spoke'

The basic steps to getting these Mood distinctions working in our grammar was adding their values to the TAM section of the choices file. Slightly more complex was the phonotactics. Some of our affixes for Mood existed in their already-inferred forms, but in general they were scattered around the the Verb Position Classes, likely due to scarcity of data. Since all of these clitics are mutually exclusive, we decided to consolidate them into one Position Class. To do this, we picked the Position Class with the clitic we see most in the data (PC161, INDIC.1sg) and made this our chosen position class. Next, we searched the affixes in the choices file for already-existing Mood clitics inferred into different PCs. When we found these, we added them to PC161, and also added their inputs to PC161. Then we deleted the position classes that were left empty. Lastly, we filled out PC161 with the rest of the Mood/Subject-Agreement paradigm as described in our grammar by Davidson.
