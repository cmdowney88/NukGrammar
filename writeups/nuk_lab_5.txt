    -The most ambiguous item in our both our Testsuite and Corpus was Testsuite Example 43:

        #EXAMPLE 43
        Source: author
        Vetted: f
        Judgment: g
        Phenomena: {clausal-mod}
        weʔič=!aƛ=maˑḥ ʔani ciq=!aƛ=qaˑ
        sleep=TEMP=INDIC=1sg because speak=TEMP=SUBOR.3
        'I am sleeping because he/she is speaking'
    
    One source of ambiguity for this item seems to be that the PP modifier (that's how the subordinate clause is parsed) can either modify a VP or a whole sentence. Since the matrix VP is fully saturated with a dropped Subject, it can be parsed either as a VP or an S and the PP can modify either one. Another source of ambiguity that we have discussed before is Verb Position Class 2, which seems to allow null affixing, because it is allowed to either apply or not apply to each VP present. Finally, it seems we accidentally included duplicate 3rd-Person Subordinate suffixes, leading to the third power of 2 in our ambiguity.

e. For 4 items that parse, do the Semantics look reasonable?

## Clausal Modifiers ##
The most clear-cut case of clausal modifiers in Nuuchahnulth is "because" clauses of the form "I am sleeping because he is talking" (Example 43). In general, subordinate clauses are marked by Mood clitics appearing on the subordinate verb. However, "because" clauses are also demarcated by the apparent complementizer ʔani. When used in this way, subordinate clauses also have to take the clitic indicating the Subordinate Mood.

#EXAMPLE 43
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {clausal-mod}
weʔič=!aƛ=maˑḥ ʔani ciq=!aƛ=qaˑ
sleep=TEMP=INDIC=1sg because speak=TEMP=SUBOR.3
'I am sleeping because he/she is speaking'

#EXAMPLE 46
Source: c:2000
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {clausal-mod}
ciq=!aƛ=maˑḥ ʔani ʔaya=!aƛ p̓iš-mis ʔaḥkuu=ʔiˑ
speak=TEMP=INDIC.1sg COMP many=NOW bad-NMLZ D1=ARTL
'I am speaking because there is much evil here now'

To enable these sorts of constructions in our Nuuchahnulth grammar, we added a strategy to the Clausal Modifiers section of the customization system. The strategy specifies a free subordinator to come before the subordinate clause that acts as the head of the phrase and introduces a _because_subord_rel. Some data from the corpus suggests that the behavior of this subordinator may be slightly more complex than we postulate here, showing possible agreement with the subject of the coordinated phrase (Example 45), but for the time being we have chosen not to model this distinction.

'They can't be seen because we're so far out at sea'

## Evidentials ##

Our treatment of evidentials led us down a route that became more complicated than we anticipated, but added significant clarity to our grammar. In Nuuchahnulth, things like Hearsay, Doubt, Indication, Assertion, and Question are all indicated through a mutually-exclusive paradigm of Mood clitics (Davidson does note that Hearsay and Doubt can co-occure but with separate clitics which was beyond tehe scope for this week). There are 12 Mood values in total, and we refined Indicative, Quotative, Subordinate, Conditional, and Dubiative for this week. The confusion for our work this week came from the fact that these Mood clitics are always accompanied by material indexing the Person and Number of the clause Subject. This material differs significantly between each of the Moods, and in different resources it is inconsistently marked as either Fusional or Agglutinating (clear boundary). In the end, we chose to abide by the Fusional analysis, and so refined choices for 5 affixes for each Mood: one each for 1sg, 1pl, 2sg, 2pl, and 3rd (no number on 3rd). These can be seen in Examples 54, 58, and 59

#EXAMPLE 54
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {evidential, negation}
wik=!aƛ=weˑʔisi ciq-šiƛ
NEG=TEMP=QUOT.1sg speak-PERF
'It is said that I didn't speak'

#EXAMPLE 58
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {evidential, agreement, mood}
ciq-šiƛ=!aƛ=weˑʔincuk
speak-PERF=TEMP=QUOT.2sg
'It is said that you spoke'

#EXAMPLE 59
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {evidential, agreement, mood}
ciq-šiƛ=!aƛ=weˑʔinni
speak-PERF=TEMP=QUOT.1pl
'It is said that we spoke'

The basic steps to getting these Mood distinctions working in our grammar was adding their values to the TAM section of the choices file. Slightly more complex was the phonotactics. Some of our affixes for Mood existed in their already-inferred forms, but in general they were scattered around the the Verb Position Classes, likely due to scarcity of data. Since all of these clitics are mutually exclusive, we decided to consolidate them into one Position Class. To do this, we picked the Position Class with the clitic we see most in the data (PC161, INDIC.1sg) and made this our chosen position class. Next, we searched the affixes in the choices file for already-existing Mood clitics inferred into different PCs. When we found these, we added them to PC161, and also added their inputs to PC161. Then we deleted the position classes that were left empty. Lastly, we filled out PC161 with the rest of the Mood/Subject-Agreement paradigm as described in our grammar by Davidson.

## Clausal Complements ##

There are a number of different types of clausal complements in Nuuchahnulth. To keep our scope reasonable, we decided to extend our work on Mood and focus on mood-marked conditional clausal complements. These clauses always include a COND marking suffix and then fill the complement role to a transitive verb. As discussed in class and on Canvas, there are some arguments to be made that these function as control verbs but that is dependant on the glosses. However, this analysis cannot be implemented from the choices file so we decided to use the conditional clausal complement analysis and simply choose our examples carefully as suggested by you.
IGT examples of clausal comlements:

#EXAMPLE 42
Source: a:158
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {clausal-comp, evidential}
t'apat-šiƛ=!aƛ=weˑʔin ḥaakʷaˑƛ=ʔiˑ wał-šiƛ=!aƛ=quu
think-PERF=TEMP=QUOT.3 girl=ART go.home-PERF=TEMP=COND.3
'The girl decided to go home'

#EXAMPLE 47
Source: c:34100
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {clausal-comp}
nay̓iik=suuk t̓iqʷ-piƛ ƛupk-šiƛ=!aƛ=quuk
immediately=NEUT.2sg sit-indoors.PERF wake=PERF=NOW=COND.2sg
'Get up as soon as you wake up'

Using the choices file, we added a simple clausal-comp strategy with two requirements: the postion is the same as the non-clausal comp and the embedded verb must have the COND feature. Next, we modified the valence of the transitive verbs for which we found examples with clausal complements. With the previous work further developing mood we were able to get the Davidson example to parse. However, even the simple examples from the corpus were giving us issues and are not fully parsing yet. It looks like there is addition work to be done make sure all the examples fit into the correct position classes in our grammar.

#### 4 (Features in the Test Suite not Covered by the Customization System) ####------------------------------------------
As noted in the Evidential section, Quotative and Dubitative clitics can both mark the same word so we have included examples of this for future work:

#EXAMPLE 50 -- corpus example simplified by author plus dubitative

Phenomena: {evidential}
ʔu-!aap=nit=waˑʔiš=qaˑč̓a nism̓a

'He bought land (hearsay, doubtful)'

#EXAMPLE 51 -- corpus example simplified by author but dubitative proceeds quotative ungrammatically
Source: c:42026
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {evidential}
ʔu-!aap=nit=qaˑč̓a=waˑʔiš nism̓a
