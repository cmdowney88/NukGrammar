## Clausal Complements ##

## Clausal Modifiers ##
The most clear-cut case of clausal modifiers in Nuuchahnulth is "because" clauses of the form "I am sleeping because he is talking" (Example 43). In general, subordinate clauses are marked by Mood clitics appearing on the subordinate verb. However, "because" clauses are also demarcated by the apparent complementizer ʔani. When used in this way, subordinate clauses also have to take the clitic indicating the Subordinate Mood.

#EXAMPLE 43
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {clausal-mod}
weʔič=!aƛ=maˑḥ ʔani ciq=!aƛ=qaˑ
sleep=TEMP=INDIC=1sg because speak=TEMP=SUBOR.3
'I am sleeping because he/she is speaking'

#EXAMPLE 46
Source: c:2000
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {clausal-mod}
ciq=!aƛ=maˑḥ ʔani ʔaya=!aƛ p̓iš-mis ʔaḥkuu=ʔiˑ
speak=TEMP=INDIC.1sg COMP many=NOW bad-NMLZ D1=ARTL
'I am speaking because there is much evil here now'

To enable these sorts of constructions in our Nuuchahnulth grammar, we added a strategy to the Clausal Modifiers section of the customization system. The strategy specifies a free subordinator to come before the subordinate clause that acts as the head of the phrase and introduces a _because_subord_rel. Some data from the corpus suggests that the behavior of this subordinator may be slightly more complex than we postulate here, showing possible agreement with the subject of the coordinated phrase (Example 45), but for the time being we have chosen not to model this distinction.

#EXAMPLE 45

'They can't be seen because we're so far out at sea'

## Evidentials ##

Our treatment of evidentials led us down a route that became more complicated than we anticipated, but added significant clarity to our grammar. In Nuuchahnulth, things like Hearsay, Doubt, Indication, Assertion, and Question are all indicated through a mutually-exclusive paradigm of Mood clitics. There are 12 Mood values in total, and we refined Indicative, Quotative, Subordinate, Conditional, and Dubiative for this week. The confusion for our work this week came from the fact that these Mood clitics are always accompanied by material indexing the Person and Number of the clause Subject. This material differs significantly between each of the Moods, and in different resources it is inconsistently marked as either Fusional or Agglutinating (clear boundary). In the end, we chose to abide by the Fusional analysis, and so refined choices for 5 affixes for each Mood: one each for 1sg, 1pl, 2sg, 2pl, and 3rd
