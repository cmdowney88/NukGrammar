1. May I share this and future write ups with Kristen for her dissertation work?
Yes, please share our work with Kristen.

2. Description the steps you had to take to get from the automatically constructed choice file to one that would both (a) customize and (b) compile.
Our choice file was too large to customize with the web interface but we were able to manually modify the choices file and download the command line validation script to check those changes. We made the following changes to the choice file in order to get it to compile:
     -The original choices file was taken from the Google Drive
     -The choices file initially only had the "Lexicon" section, and so it was rejected as invalid by the grammar customization system
     -We added the necessary lines from our "toy" English choices file from the beginning of class to allow compilation.
     -We adjusted the Word Order section to fit with the "Verb-Initial" description in the Davidson grammar
          -(Subject and Object can occur in either order after the verb)
          -(There also don't appear to be determiners or auxiliaries)
     -The grammar at this stage was still not validating due to the status of Determiners being left unspecified for each noun class
     	  -To fix this we added "noun##_det=opt" to every noun class
     -The grammar was now validating for everything except the Morphology tab.
     	  -To address this, we used the manual validator which told us that the grammar. This gave the error "You have selected an invalid feature value" for a large number of verbs. After trying a few tweeks, we found that the grammar compiled when the - in the value name was replaced with _. 

     -Initial tsdb runs showed 0 coverage, so we went back to the Grammar Customization to add argument optionality
          -At this point, we allow both the subject and object to be optional everywhere

With these coices we were able to generate our initial grammar. However, we still had to make a few manual changes to the grammar.
     -Escaped ! ( ) . in irules.tdl so that they would parse correctly.
     -Because . is used intra-word, we were having issues with the sentence ending periods. We stripped these from our corpus for now so that we can parse the sentences without errors based off trying to treat sentence ending periods as words.

3. Your answers to the questions about the [incr tsdb()] run, repeated here.
        1. How many items parsed?
        2. What is the average number of parses per parsed item?
        3. How many parses did the most ambiguous item receive?
        4. What sources of ambiguity can you identify?
        5. For 10 items (if you have at least that many parsing), do any of the parses look reasonable in the semantics? (Emily will demo in class on Tuesday.) 

4. If you have identified ways in which the automatically created choices file is particularly off-base, please report them here. If you can include IGT from the testsuite or your descriptive materials illustrating the problem, that is even better.
