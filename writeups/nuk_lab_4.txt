## Coordination ##
When Nuuchahnulth shows overt coordination, it does so with the separate word ʔuḥʔiš, glossed as 'and'. While we have not found a vetted example with more than two conjucts, this word seems to allow either Monosyndeton (A B and C) or Polysyndeton (A and B and C) type coordiantion, though it is unclear from the data. In the corpus, this word seems to be used mostly to coordinate NPs (see Examples 20 and 21). Omnisyndeton marking does not seem to be possible, and we have designed our grammar to rule it out (Example 22).

In order to enable this type of coordination, we used the Grammar Matrix Customization System to add the correct coordination method: specified as a Polysyndeton method using as separate word whose orthography is ʔuḥʔiš, and that comes before the coordinand.

In order to model this, I defined a tense inflection slot that takes auxiliary verbs as input. In this slot, one of the morphemes is the future marker ma. This marker constrains the TENSE to be "future" on the verb. I've also defined a tense inflection slot on the main verbs. It has only one morpheme: the future marker ba. Just like ma, ba constraints TENSE on the verb to be "future". This slot is optional, so verbs without ba are unmarked. Because the other things in the auxiliary tense slot specify TENSE values that inconsistent with "future", ba-marked verbs should only co-occur with ma-marked auxiliaries. 

A. Negation: in Nuuchahlnulth sentenial negation is created by the verb 'wik' ~ 'not' which proceedes begins the sentence. It takes the usual inflectional suffixes for tense, aspect, mood, person, number. It can function as an auxilary verb as in example 18 bellow, negating the verb sleep or as a stand-alone negative verb as in example 19 with implied comliments.

#EXAMPLE 18

Vetted: s
Judgement: g
Phenomena: {neg}
wik=!aƛ=quu=s weʔič ʔatḥii
not=TEMP=COND=1sg sleep night
`I did not sleep nights'

#EXAMPLE 19

Vetted: f
Judgement: g
Phenomena: {neg}
wik-šiƛ=!aƛ=maˑ=aˑḥ
not-PERF=TEMP=INDIC=1sg
`I did not speak'

To build this negation, we started with Kristen's specification in the choice file which enabled negating auxilary verbs and created the basic negative auxilary verb class with the desired neg_rel. This replaced the inflectional negation she had us use last week to get the grammar to compile. We then gave the negative auxilary the feature form with value finite along with the corresponding complabell=finite. This gave us the baic negative auxiliary we needed. Next, we noted that this auxiliary verb used the same suffixes as the non-auxialry 'wik'~'not' (verb78) which was already in the choice file. To take advantage of this, we added the neg-aux-lex as input to verb-pc116 which is the obligatory, non-inflecting, negation position class taking verb78 as input. This meant we could now attach to the desired suffixes execpt one which was easily done by adding verb-pc116 as input to verb-pc114. This allowed the examples to parse with the desired neg_rel.

B. Possession: In Nuuchahnulth possession is marked with a suffix, either =uk or =ʔak, depending on whether it is proceeded by a vowel or not. Other suffixes handle PNG features so these are relatively simple suffixes simply adding the poss_rel. These suffixes usually appears on the possesum but there was one example in our source that showed the true possessive system involves second-posistion possession marking. However, the Grammar Matrix does not support this directly. Due to the scope of this class, we decided to simplify this to a possessum marking suffix since this captures most of the examples in our sources. We also note that the possesum can occure without the possessor so we need to create an additonal 'pronoun' version of the suffixes that fill the poss_rel when the possessor is not present.
