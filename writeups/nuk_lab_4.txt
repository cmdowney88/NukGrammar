## Coordination ##
When Nuuchahnulth shows overt coordination, it does so with the separate word ʔuḥʔiš, glossed as 'and'. While we have not found a vetted example with more than two conjucts, this word seems to allow either Monosyndeton (A B and C) or Polysyndeton (A and B and C) type coordiantion, though it is unclear from the data. In the corpus, this word seems to be used mostly to coordinate NPs (see Examples 20 and 21). Omnisyndeton marking does not seem to be possible, and we have designed our grammar to rule it out (Example 22).

ʔu-naˑk=(m)it ʔuḥʔiš LR-maḥt̓iˑ ʔuḥʔiš čiicsac

In order to enable this type of coordination, we used the Grammar Matrix Customization System to add the correct coordination method: specified as a Polysyndeton method using as separate word whose orthography is ʔuḥʔiš, and that comes before the coordinand.

## Negation ##
In Nuuchahlnulth sentenial negation is created by the verb 'wik' ~ 'not' which proceeds begins the sentence. It takes the usual inflectional suffixes for tense, aspect, mood, person, number. It can function as an auxiliary verb as in example 18 bellow, negating the verb sleep or as a stand-alone negative verb as in example 19 with implied comliments.

#EXAMPLE 18
Source: a:155
Vetted: s
Judgement: g
Phenomena: {neg}
wik=!aƛ=quu=s weʔič ʔatḥii
not=TEMP=COND=1sg sleep night
`I did not sleep nights'

#EXAMPLE 19
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgement: g
Phenomena: {neg}
wik-šiƛ=!aƛ=maˑ=aˑḥ
not-PERF=TEMP=INDIC=1sg
`I did not speak'

To build this negation, we started with Kristen's specification in the choice file which enabled negating auxilary verbs and created the basic negative auxilary verb class with the desired neg_rel. This replaced the inflectional negation she had us use last week to get the grammar to compile. We then gave the negative auxilary the feature form with value finite along with the corresponding complabell=finite. This gave us the baic negative auxiliary we needed. Next, we noted that this auxiliary verb used the same suffixes as the non-auxialry 'wik'~'not' (verb78) which was already in the choice file. To take advantage of this, we added the neg-aux-lex as input to verb-pc116 which is the obligatory, non-inflecting, negation position class taking verb78 as input. This meant we could now attach to the desired suffixes execpt one which was easily done by adding verb-pc116 as input to verb-pc114. This allowed the examples to parse with the desired neg_rel.

## Possession ##
In Nuuchahnulth possession is marked with a suffix, either =uk or =ʔak, depending on whether it is proceeded by a vowel or not. Other suffixes handle PNG features so these are relatively simple suffixes simply adding the poss_rel without worrying about agreement. These suffixes appear head initial and usually appears on the possesum but there was one example in our source that showed the true possessive system involves second-posistion possession marking where the suffix was sentence initial but not on the possessum. However, the Grammar Matrix does not support this directly. Due to the scope of this class, we decided to simplify this to a possessum marking suffix since this captures most of the examples in our sources. We also note that the possesum can occure without the possessor so we need to create an additonal 'pronoun' version of the suffixes that fill the poss_rel when the possessor is not present.

Examples:

#EXAMPLE 26

Vetted: f
Judgement: g
Phenomena: {poss}
n̓aacsa=!aƛ t̓ašii=ʔak=ʔiˑ 
see=NOW door=POSS=ARTL night
'He/She/they was looking at their door now'

#EXAMPLE 29

Judgement: g
Phenomena: {poss}

'He/she/they displayed their curtain'

#EXAMPLE 30 -- wrong possessive suffix
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgement: u
Phenomena: {poss}
ḥum-čiƛ muuyapiłum=uk=ʔiˑ
show-MO curtain=POSS=ARTL
'* He/she/they displayed their curtain'

#EXAMPLE 31 -- Second-position marking example we will not parse correctly
Source: a:307
Vetted: s
Judgement: g
Phenomena: {poss}
ʔɑƛ-qimɬ=uk=qɑˑ=s kuˑnɑˑ
two-X.many.round.objects=POSS=DEF=1sg schooner
'My two schooners'

In order to capture this possesive system, we worked with Elizabeth Nielsen to create a possession strategy and possesive pronoun as needed. The possessive strategy was created to capture the above description: a head-initial, possessum marking, non-agreeing affix that functions as a modifier. The pronoun class further specified that is was also a modifiying, non-agreeing affix. The two suffixes already existed in the possition classes so we simply had to add the correct features to them--feat_name:possessum, feat_value:possessum, feat_head:itself. Then we created two possition classes that added the pronoun features instead (in class, David had incorrectly added the possession strategy features to both which resulted in no pronoun suffixes and much confusion). These pronoun classes tooke the same inputs and were in turn used as inputs to the same position classes as the existion possession suffixes. After that, we only had to add one noun as input to the POSS pcs and we were off and parsing; we now correctly parsed the coordination + possession example that was failing in class.
