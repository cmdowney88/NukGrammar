a. How many items parsed?
    -Initial: Testsuite-14, Corpus-30
    -Final: Testsuite-24, Corpus-37

b. What was the average number of parses?
    -Initial: Testsuite-1.5, Corpus-2.23
    -Final: Testsuite-1.96, Corpus-2.41

c. How many parses did the most ambiguous item receive?
    -Initial: Testsuite-4, Corpus-6
    -Final: Testsuite-6, Corpus-6

d. What sources of ambiguity can you identify?
    -In general, the level that S immediately dominates seems oddly unconstrained. For example, the combination of a (fully inflected) verb and NP seems to be able to be parsed as (S -> VP -> VP NP), (S -> V -> V NP), (S -> VP NP), (S -> VP -> V NP), or (S -> VP NP). It seems like the ability to drop arguments leads to a somewhat wild diversity in how these two words can be parsed, and we aren't exactly sure how to constrain that at this point.

e. For 10 items that parse, do the Semantics look reasonable?
    -Example 21: Reasonable, there is a "have" relation whose ARG0 is identified with HOOK.INDEX, ARG1 with HOOK.XARG, which is unexpressed, and ARG2 identified with the coordinated phrase semantics. This in turn has an L-INDEX and R-INDEX identified with the ARG0s of a "house" relation and "troll-boat" relation respectively. There are three quantification (exist) relations, one for each of the nouns, and one for the whole coordinated phrase. We don't really know where these come from.

## Coordination ##
When Nuuchahnulth shows overt coordination, it does so with the separate word ʔuḥʔiš, glossed as 'and'. While we have not found a vetted example with more than two conjucts, this word seems to allow either Monosyndeton (A B and C) or Polysyndeton (A and B and C) type coordiantion, though it is unclear from the data. In the corpus, this word seems to be used mostly to coordinate NPs (see Examples 20 and 21). Omnisyndeton marking does not seem to be possible, and we have designed our grammar to rule it out (Example 22).

In order to enable this type of coordination, we used the Grammar Matrix Customization System to add the correct coordination method: specified as a Polysyndeton method using as separate word whose orthography is ʔuḥʔiš, and that comes before the coordinand. Though we have not found a corpus example of two VPs or Ss linked by coordination in this way, we set this coordination strategy to be able to link NPs, VPs, or Ss, mainly because we know that VP and S can be coordinated, but we only see examples of this being done by juxtaposition, and juxtaposition is currently crashing the parser when we set it to allow juxtaposed coordinated S. (The process throughs a memory error and sometimes freezes up both the virtual and host computer.

## Negation ##
In Nuuchahlnulth sentenial negation is created by the verb 'wik' ~ 'not' which proceeds begins the sentence. It takes the usual inflectional suffixes for tense, aspect, mood, person, number. It can function as an auxiliary verb as in example 18 bellow, negating the verb sleep or as a stand-alone negative verb as in example 19 with implied comliments.

#EXAMPLE 18

Vetted: s
Judgement: g
Phenomena: {neg}
wik=!aƛ=quu=s weʔič ʔatḥii
not=TEMP=COND=1sg sleep night

Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgement: g
Phenomena: {neg}
wik-šiƛ=!aƛ=maˑ=aˑḥ
not-PERF=TEMP=INDIC=1sg
`I did not speak'

To build this negation, we started with Kristen's specification in the choice file which enabled negating auxilary verbs and created the basic negative auxilary verb class with the desired neg_rel. This replaced the inflectional negation she had us use last week to get the grammar to compile. We then gave the negative auxilary the feature form with value finite along with the corresponding complabell=finite. This gave us the baic negative auxiliary we needed. Next, we noted that this auxiliary verb used the same suffixes as the non-auxialry 'wik'~'not' (verb78) which was already in the choice file. To take advantage of this, we added the neg-aux-lex as input to verb-pc116 which is the obligatory, non-inflecting, negation position class taking verb78 as input. This meant we could now attach to the desired suffixes execpt one which was easily done by adding verb-pc116 as input to verb-pc114. This allowed the examples to parse with the desired neg_rel.

## Possession ##
In Nuuchahnulth possession is marked with a suffix, either =uk or =ʔak, depending on whether it is proceeded by a vowel or not. Other suffixes handle PNG features so these are relatively simple suffixes simply adding the poss_rel without worrying about agreement. These suffixes appear head initial and usually appears on the possesum but there was one example in our source that showed the true possessive system involves second-posistion possession marking where the suffix was sentence initial but not on the possessum. However, the Grammar Matrix does not support this directly. Due to the scope of this class, we decided to simplify this to a possessum marking suffix since this captures most of the examples in our sources. We also note that the possesum can occure without the possessor so we need to create an additonal 'pronoun' version of the suffixes that fill the poss_rel when the possessor is not present.

Examples:

#EXAMPLE 26

Vetted: f

see=NOW door=POSS=ARTL night

Judgement: g
Phenomena: {poss}
ʔɑƛ-qimɬ=uk=qɑˑ=s kuˑnɑˑ

In order to capture this possesive system, we worked with Elizabeth Nielsen to create a possession strategy and possesive pronoun as needed. The possessive strategy was created to capture the above description: a head-initial, possessum marking, non-agreeing affix that functions as a modifier. The pronoun class further specified that is was also a modifiying, non-agreeing affix. The two suffixes already existed in the possition classes so we simply had to add the correct features to them--feat_name:possessum, feat_value:possessum, feat_head:itself. Then we created two possition classes that added the pronoun features instead (in class, David had incorrectly added the possession strategy features to both which resulted in no pronoun suffixes and much confusion). These pronoun classes tooke the same inputs and were in turn used as inputs to the same position classes as the existion possession suffixes. After that, we only had to add one noun as input to the POSS pcs and we were off and parsing; we now correctly parsed the coordination + possession example that was failing in class. 

#### 4 Features in the Test Suite not Covered by the Customization System ####
-Some of the examples of our testsuite exhibit imperative sentences, which came up when looking for negation examples, because they are negative imperatives like "don't fight" (see Examples 35,36). This sort of sentence in theory would be compatible with the radical dropping syntax of Nuuchahnulth, but it seems these sentences are not parsing right now for morphotactic reasons, specifically, wheter inflection is satisfied by the imperative.

-There are also a couple examples of Evidentials (like Heresay), but I am unsure if phenomena like these are handled by the matrix in general yet. We seemt to have them morphotactically parsed well, but they don't add the Evidential information to our MRS
