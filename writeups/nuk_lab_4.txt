## Coordination ##
When Nuuchahnulth shows overt coordination, it does so with the separate word ʔuḥʔiš, glossed as 'and'. While we have not found a vetted example with more than two conjucts, this word seems to allow either Monosyndeton (A B and C) or Polysyndeton (A and B and C) type coordiantion, though it is unclear from the data. In the corpus, this word seems to be used mostly to coordinate NPs (see Examples 20 and 21). Omnisyndeton marking does not seem to be possible, and we have designed our grammar to rule it out (Example 22).

In order to enable this type of coordination, we used the Grammar Matrix Customization System to add the correct coordination method: specified as a Polysyndeton method using as separate word whose orthography is ʔuḥʔiš, and that comes before the coordinand.

In order to model this, I defined a tense inflection slot that takes auxiliary verbs as input. In this slot, one of the morphemes is the future marker ma. This marker constrains the TENSE to be "future" on the verb. I've also defined a tense inflection slot on the main verbs. It has only one morpheme: the future marker ba. Just like ma, ba constraints TENSE on the verb to be "future". This slot is optional, so verbs without ba are unmarked. Because the other things in the auxiliary tense slot specify TENSE values that inconsistent with "future", ba-marked verbs should only co-occur with ma-marked auxiliaries.
