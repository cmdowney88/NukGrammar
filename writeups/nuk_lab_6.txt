## Denomializing Constructions ##
    In Nuuchahnulth, clauses copula-like meaning of the sort "I am a girl", "you are a tree", are expressed through a verb that is derived from the corresponding noun. These sorts of predicates is what Davidson calls "class-inclusion predicates", which are marked differently from "equivalence predicates" like "I am the girl" (see below). An example of this type of sentence is seen in Example 63:

    #EXAMPLE 63
    Source: author
    Vetted: f
    Judgement: g
    Phenomena: {nominal-pred}
    suč̓as=eˑʔic
    tree=INDIC.2sg
    'You are a tree'

    suč̓as is a Noun root that introduces the tree_n_rel. In order to allow the type of predicational use of this relation seen in the example, we introduced a lexical rule that forms a Verb lexeme from a corresponding Noun lexeme:

denominal-verb-lex-rule-super := constant-lex-rule & nocoord & verb-pc15-or-verb-pc161-rule-dtr &
[ SYNSEM [ LOCAL [ CAT [ HEAD verb & [MOD < > ],
                         VAL [ SPEC < >,
                               COMPS < >,
                               SUBJ < [ LOCAL [ CAT.HEAD noun,
                                                CONT.HOOK.INDEX #xarg ] ] > ] ],
                   CONT.HOOK #hook  ],
           LKEYS.KEYREL #keyrel ],
 C-CONT [ HCONS <! qeq & [ HARG #harg,
                           LARG #larg ] !>,
          RELS <! #keyrel & arg12-ev-relation &
                  [ LBL #ltop,
                    ARG0 #index,
                    ARG1 #xarg,
                    ARG2 #dtr_ind ],
                  quant-relation &
                  [ PRED "exist_q_rel",
                    ARG0 #dtr_ind,
                    RSTR #harg ] !>,
          ICONS <! !>,
          HOOK #hook & [ LTOP #ltop,
                 INDEX #index,
                 XARG #xarg ] ],

 DTR noun-lex & [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CONT.HOOK [ LTOP #larg,
                                           INDEX #dtr_ind ] ] ].

denominal-verb-lex-rule := denominal-verb-lex-rule-super &
  [ SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "_be_v_id_rel" ].

    This rule was based off of the solution proposed on Canvas for Yupik. The rule takes as its DTR a Noun Lexeme and identifies its LTOP with the LARG value of the Mother's HCONS list. In addition, it identifies the INDEX of the Noun with the ARG0 of a exist_q_rel and the ARG2 of the copular _be_v_id_rel (which is actually enforced by the rule subtype. Thus, this rule creates a verb that establishes the identity between the Noun relation and the XARG of the verb (the subject).

    It is also worth noting that, since this copular form is intransitive, our grammar correctly rules out clauses with too many arguments, like Example 83

    Source: author
    Vetted: f
    Judgement: u
    Phenomena: {nom-pred}
    ḥaakʷaˑƛ=maˑḥ meʔiƛqac
    girl=INDIC.1sg boy
    intended: *'I am a girl a boy'

## Locative Predicates ##
    One class of Nuuchahnulth Locative Predicates are similar to denomial ones in that they seem to be expressed by a verb-like item (it at least takes the usual series of what we classify as Verbal affixes. This can be seen in Example 66 from our testsuite and the following example from our corpus.
    
    #EXAMPLE 66
    Source: author
    Vetted: f
    Judgement: g
    Phenomena: {locative-pred}
    hił=maˑ suč̓as ḥaakʷaˑƛ
    at=INDIC.3 tree girl
    'the girl is at the tree'

    hił=int=waˑʔš maḥt̓aʕs
    at=PST=HRSY.3 Queens.Cove
    He was at Queens Cove

    Since we see no evidence that this predicate type needs to co-occur with any other items like that are adpositional or auxiliary in nature, we analyze it (at least in terms of our implementation) as being of a simple transitive-verb lexeme type. Thus, we established the following lexical entry and lexical type:

    hił := verb20-verb-lex &
  [ STEM < "hił" >,
    SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "_be+located_v_rel" ].

    verb20-verb-lex := transitive-verb-lex & (inferred verb position classes)......

    Our grammar also correctly rules out examples with extra arguments that don't agree with the predicate, as in Example 68:

    #EXAMPLE 68
    Source: author
    Vetted: f
    Judgement: u
    Phenomena: {locative-pred, agr}
    hił=maˑḥ suč̓as ḥaakʷaˑƛ
    at=INDIC.1sg tree girl
    intended: '*the girl is at the tree'

It is also worth noting that there are also locative suffixes in Nuuchahnulth but we cannot support them with our current grammar because we would have to move to treating the suffixes as second position auxilaries which is out of scope due to requiring us to reverse one of the fundimental assumptions of our grammar.

## Copular (Identity) Predicates ##
    As mentioned previously, Nuuchahnulth marks "copular" type Nominal predicates slightly differently depending on the precise type. As shown above, clauses that translate roughly to "I am a ___" are constructed by deriving verbal lexemes from the corresponding nominal root. Sentences that are of the type "I am THE ___" i.e., ones where the nominal predicate is definite, are marked using a different strategy, where the nominal is a complement of a Verb-like word. This can be seen in Examples 69 and 70:

    #EXAMPLE 69
    Source: a:213
    Vetted: f
    Judgment: g
    Phenomena: {copula}
    siy̓aaq=maˑḥ meʔiƛqac
    1sg.PRED=INDIC.1sg boy
    'I am the boy'

    #EXAMPLE 70
    Source: a:215
    Vetted: f
    Judgment: g
    Phenomena: {copula}
    siy̓aaq=maˑḥ ciq-šiƛ
    1sg.PRED=INDIC.1sg speak-PERF
    'It is I who speaks'

    #EXAMPLE 73
    Source: author
    Vetted: f
    Judgement: u
    Phenomena: {copula}
    siy̓aaq=maˑḥ
    1sg.PRED=INDIC.1sg
    Fragment: *'I am...'

    (Note: 70 is outside of our scope right now because the complement of the copula must be Nominal, and we do not have a way of making "wh-clauses" yet, to accomodate the "who speaks" clause). In order to enable this, we added the roots siy̓aaq "I" (glossed 1sg.PRED) and suw̓aaq "you" (glossed 2sg.PRED) as transitive verb roots with a lexical relation _be_v_id_rel, linking the the complement of the Verb to the XARG with the lexical specification that the Subject is always 1sg, 2sg, etc. It is also notable that these copula constructions differ from the "class membership" ones in that they MUST take a complement. Copulas without complements like Example 73 are correctly ruled out by our grammar. This analysis of these items as Verb roots seems justified for our purposes for two reasons:
    
    1. These items take all the same affixes that we have analyzed to be part of verb morphology
    2. While these items can be glossed as "pronouns", they are very rare as free (non-first-position) morphemes in our data and descriptive grammars, and pronouns as arguments always seem to be dropped.

    The tdl entries for these copulas follow:

    copula-verb-lex := transitive-verb-lex  & (verb position classes)......
    
    1sg-copula-verb-lex := copula-verb-lex & 
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.VAL.SUBJ.FIRST.LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.INDEX.PNG [ PER 1st,
                                                                NUM sg ] ].

    2sg-copula-verb-lex := copula-verb-lex & 
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.VAL.SUBJ.FIRST.LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.INDEX.PNG [ PER 2nd,
                                                                NUM sg ] ].
